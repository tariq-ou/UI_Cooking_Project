Add recipe interface and ingredient interface and figure out how to incorprate them into what you have so far

fix recipe detail component and make it nicer , should have recipe pulled through by id and make the button pretie. see whatyou need to do

you need to get your backend to return Id along side the other bits for the recipe dto so it can be used in routing
