will neeed to find somewhere to do deletes also
will need to add an option for editing a recipe also
mabye add in some methods to actually read from the service now and add into ther classes through interface calls
design home page ect to look nice - pick ur colours and style - probably get rid of the white background. black and orange colour you have now mabye doesnt sound too bad. or a really low chroma nice clour like pink ect


you need to get your backend to return Id along side & might as well add a notes property to recipe which is a string array - image location - the other bits for the recipe dto so it can be used in routing
